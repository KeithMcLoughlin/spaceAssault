DT228-2 OOP Assignment 2

I was tasked with making my very first Objected Oriented Game using everything we learned so far.
All the artwork is procedurally generationed.

The game starts off in the main menu, where you can check the controls

There are a variety of enemies including heat seeking mines, asteroids, eyebots that have one laser and heavy ships with two lasers.
Your ship can shoot in three directions. There are two types of powerups - health & ammo.

Stage 2 has you entering the mothership where you encounter turrents that lock onto your position

Finally you face the final boss who has two rapid firing laser cannons but has a big glowing weak spot.

When the boss is defeated, you can relax as a hero!
